The main goals of morfeo are:

- create a single source of truth for the style of your application
- separate the style of a component from its logic.

The first goal is reached by stylize your components using aliases instead of values, for example `color: "primary"`instead of `color: "#06f"` as better explained [here](../Features/single-source-of-truth.mdx).

To understand the second goal, let me show you an example:

```typescript
const successButtonStyle = morfeo.resolve({
  bg: 'success',
  corner: 'm', // <----
  borderWidth: 'xs', // <----
  borderColor: 'success.darkest',
});

const dangerButtonStyle = morfeo.resolve({
  bg: 'error',
  corner: 'l', // <----
  borderWidth: '2xs', // <----
  borderColor: 'errror.darkest',
});
```

As you can see, in this example each style is following the design language, but the buttons where these styles will be applied will still look **inconsistent** since they have different `borderRadius` and `borderWidths`.

:::info The truth is
**following a design language is not enough to ensure consistency**

Thats why morfeo natively support components inside the theme, let's rewrite the example above:

```typescript
// inside the theme object
const theme = {
  ...restOfTheTheme,
  components: {
    Button: {
      style: {
        corner: 'm',
        borderWidth: 'xs',
      },
      variants: {
        success: {
          style: {
            bg: 'success',
            borderColor: 'success.darkest',
          },
        },
        error: {
          style: {
            bg: 'error',
            borderColor: 'error.darkest',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

const successButtonStyle = morfeo.resolve({
  componentName: 'Button',
  variant: 'success',
});

const dangerButtonStyle = morfeo.resolve({
  componentName: 'Button',
  variant: 'error',
});
```

As you can see, now the style of the buttons is centralized inside the theme, the generated styles are not based on a style object but instead by referring to theme components, and this is a **huge** advantage since now you can apply these styles to every button you have all-around your application, no matter why they are built for.
