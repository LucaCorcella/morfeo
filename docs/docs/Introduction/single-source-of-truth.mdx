### Single source of truth

The main concept of morfeo is the theme, this object contains the **design language** of your application.

All the style generated by morfeo is stronly dependent on this object, this will ensure that **every components is following the style guides**, for example this style:

```typescript title="style object"
const style = {
  padding: 's',
  bg: 'primary.300',
  borderRadius: 'm',
};
```

Will be converted in a different CSS-in-JS object depending on how you configure your theme:

<ThemeSelect style={{ padding: 's', bg: 'primary.300', borderRadius: 'm' }} />
