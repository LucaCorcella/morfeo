One of the most important feature of morfeo is the [dev-tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/morfeo/phhhjdmeicikchjnpepljcdgbmipipcl),
with the dev tool you'll always be able to see your theme and play with it.

## Installation

You can install the dev tool by going to chrome web store and add it to your plugins:

  className="button button--primary button--lg"
  to="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/morfeo/phhhjdmeicikchjnpepljcdgbmipipcl"
  style={{ color: 'white' }}
>

Once you have done the installation, open the chrome devtool by inspecting the page or simply typing:
