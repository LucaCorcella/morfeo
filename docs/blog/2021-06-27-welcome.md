Hello everyone and welcome!
In this blog, we will post updates, news, and tutorials about [morfeo](https://morfeo.dev), but you can always find complete documentation in the [Docs](/docs/Introduction/getting-started) section.

### Work with us

If you want to help us improve morfeo, be sure you've read the [contributing](https://github.com/VLK-STUDIO/morfeo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
There are a lot of ways you can help us to improve morfeo and grow as a community, for example:

- Improve documentation
- Add new functionalities
- [Fix a bug](https://github.com/VLK-STUDIO/morfeo/issues)
- Write an article about morfeo
- Give us a feedback

If you're a developer and you want to contribute [PRs are welcome!](https://github.com/VLK-STUDIO/morfeo)!
If you're not a developer or you don't want to contribute in this way, it could be extremely useful to know your thoughts about morfeo,
how we can improve the library, or just feedback. For this kind of contribution, we will always be available in the [slack channel](https://morfeo.slack.com/).
