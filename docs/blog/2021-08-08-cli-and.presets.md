Today we are going to release 2 new features:

- a CLI that generates static CSS based on the theme
- a theme preset to easily start using morfeo in 30 seconds (Many thanks to [Andrea](https://github.com/andreaSimonePorceddu) who made it possible)

### CLI

We are so happy to announce this new tool because it was one of the first feature we wanted to implement for morfeo!
You can find more info about it [here in the docs](https://morfeo.dev/docs/Features/CLI/morfeo-cli-introduction).

### Theme preset

In this [pull-request](https://github.com/VLK-STUDIO/morfeo/pull/62), based on this [issue](https://github.com/VLK-STUDIO/morfeo/issues/45) my friend and colleague [Andrea](https://github.com/andreaSimonePorceddu) introduces a new packages called `@morfeo/preset-default`, this package contains 2 complete themes, one dark and one light, to easily start using morfeo without create a whole complete theme your own.

Checkout more info about the preset [here](https://morfeo.dev/docs/Packages/preset-default).
